    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
        As sports betting has become legalized throughout the US, the fan viewership experience has changed forever. Fans are 
        now more invested and connected with every game in every sport. While many traditional sports book exist, we want to take
        this investment to the next level.
    </p>

    <p>
        With current sports books, you are locked into your bet the second you buy it and offered minimal cashout options from the book. 
        We wish to change this by creating a sports betting market place where you can buy and sell bets as contracts between users.
        For example, let's say early this past summer you think the Cavaliers are going to win the NBA Finals this year. You place the bet on this and are locked in at +10000 odds. 
        2 weeks later the blockbuster trade for all-star Donovan Mitchell occurs. You check the new odds and see the Cavaliers are +2500 to win. 
        You could now hold onto your original +10000 bet like a traditional sports book, or cashout to someone
        else willing to buy the odds you listed. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We plan to build the marketplace where this would be possible. Here, people can buy/sell bets similar to options in the stock market.
        Every bettor would have much more flexibility from the buying and selling perspective compared to the merely buy and wait standard.
